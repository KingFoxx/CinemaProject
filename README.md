## Introduction:

For this project we created a working website that a user can view the cinema as well as book tickets for a movie of their choice. 
* Visualisation - Balsamic Wireframe
* Project Management - Jira was used to make a todo list for the project
* Database - MySQL was used to have a relational database 
* Java SE & React - Application backend completed through React following OOP
* HTML, CSS, JS - Fronted completed with integrated API for fully functioning website
* Testing - Testing of backend using integrated test suite

### Planning
Jira allowed to track the progress of the project through the use of user stories and tasks that you can see down below. These were then thrown into a sprint and followed and checked off as the days went by. Stories were organized into Epics and were blocked by tasks to ensure they were done correctly.

Throughout the project build we completed various sprints, grouping the issues from epics to complete different sections.

Once we had decided on our user stories we started to think about the design for the website. Using Balsamic we created a wireframe and stuck to this throughout front-end creation.

### Databases

MySQL was used to store the data that is provided by the user as well as information that we also stored for our use. Columns for  were used. These inputs were tested during the initial phase via postman.

### Frontend

The front-end is built from HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used the Bootstrap framework for various components. This helped me make the website more professional using forms.

The HTML and CSS are used to create the look of the website, ****************************************
